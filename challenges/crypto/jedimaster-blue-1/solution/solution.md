# Solution
The plaintext was encoded using Aurabesh, which is the character set used in the Star Wars universe. This was hinted at in the 
challenge description and by the name of the file (learning_the_alphabet.png). Solving This challenge could be done by looking 
up a table with all the characters and then converting the image back to it's plaintext. For example:

![Aurabesh Image](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/c/cc/Aurebesh-GMSR.png/revision/latest?cb=20071202200434)

After finding a table such as this, solving the challenge just takes a little time comparing the challenge to the image.
