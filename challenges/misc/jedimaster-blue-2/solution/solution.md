# Introduction
The second challenge in this series was an OS/INT challenge in the misc category. This challenge pointed you to the Discord
server and Blue's friend "Jedimaster" (the author of the challenge). 

# Solution.
Investigating Jedimaster's linked accounts (GitHub, Twitch, Spotify, Etc.) would eventually lead you to the flag. The 
exact path for finding the flag was to visit Jedimaster's Twitch page, and then access the actual main stream page 
(Note, this is available, even when the streamer is offline). From here, the flag was hidden in one of the panels below 
the stream.
